# Chapter 04 Factory Method Design Pattern

## to leave generating instances to child classes

### 4.1 Introduction

In Factory Method Design Pattern, parent classes determine the way of generating instances, without determining the
actual type, which instances generated are, leaving everything in detail to the child classes, in such way so that the
framework, generating instances, and the class, of instances generated, are <b>decoupled</b>.
